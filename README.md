# OCT Disease Detector

This is a Node.js-based web application for detecting eye diseases. Transfer learning has been used to train the VGG16 model on roughly 84000 OCT images.
The images come from an open dataset taken from [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2)

## Install dependencies
